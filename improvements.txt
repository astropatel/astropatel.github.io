During the semester, the Cahill building at Caltech is host to a series of free lectures on Friday nights open to the public. Astronomers --- students, postdocs, and faculty --- discuss interesting topics in astronomy. At various times, I've helped out our host, <a href="http://chummels.org/">Dr. Cameron Hummels</a>, with these lectures. <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/outreach/lectures/">Check it out.</a>
